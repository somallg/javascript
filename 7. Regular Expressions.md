# 7. Regular Expressions
* A *regular expression* is the specification of the syntax of a simple language
* Use with methods to search, replace, and extract information from strings
* Methods that work with regular expressions are `regexp.exec`, `regexp.test`, `string.match`, `string.replace`, `string.search` and `string.split`

## 7.1 An Example
* Regular expression that matches URLs
```
var parseUrl = /^(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?(\/{0,3})([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)
(?::(\d+))?(?:\/([^?#]*))?(?:\?([^#]*))?(?:#(.*))?$/;
```

* `^`: beginning of the string
* `(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?` matches the scheme name, only if it is followed by a `:` (colon)
    * `(?:...)` noncapturing group
    * `?` *repeat zero or one time*
    * (...) indicates a capturing group. A capturing group copies the text it matches and places it in the result array. Each capturing group is given a number. The first capturing group is 1
    * `[..]` indicates a character class
* `[^?#]` indicates that the class includes all characters *except* `?` and `#`
* `*` indicates that the character class is matched zero or more times
* `$` represents the end of the string. It assures that there was no extra materal after the end of the URL

## 7.2 Construction
* 2 ways to make a `RegExp` object
    * Use regular expression literal
    * Use `RegExp` constructor

## 7.3 Elements

## 7.4 Regexp Choice
* A *regexp choice* contains one ore more regexp sequences. The sequences are separated by the `|` character

## 7.5 Regexp Sequence
* Contains one or more *regexp factors*

## 7.6 Regexp Factor
* Can be a character, a parenthesized group, a character class, or an escape sequence

## 7.7 Regexp Escape

## 7.8 Regexp Group
* 4 kinds of group:
    * *Capturing* wrapped in parentheses
    * *Noncapturing* has a `(?:` prefix
    * *Positive lookahead* has a `(?=` prefix like a noncapturing group except that after the group matches, the text is rewound the where the group started
    * *Negative lookahead* has a `(?!` prefix like positive lookahead group, except that it matches only if it fails to match
    
## 7.9 Regexp Class
* Way of specifying one of a set of characters

## 7.10 Regexp Class Escape

## 7.11 Regexp Quantifier
