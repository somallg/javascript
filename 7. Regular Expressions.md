# 7. Regular Expressions
* A *regular expression* is the specification of the syntax of a simple language
* Use with methods to search, replace, and extract information from strings
* Methods that work with regular expressions are `regexp.exec`, `regexp.test`, `string.match`, `string.replace`, `string.search` and `string.split`

## 7.1 An Example
* Regular expression that matches URLs
```
var parseUrl = /^(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?(\/{0,3})([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)
(?::(\d+))?(?:\/([^?#]*))?(?:\?([^#]*))?(?:#(.*))?$/;
```

* `^`: beginning of the string
* `(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?` matches the scheme name, only if it is followed by a `:` (colon)
    * `(?:...)` noncapturing group
    * `?` *repeat zero or one time*
    * (...) indicates a capturing group. A capturing group copies the text it matches and places it in the result array. Each capturing group is given a number. The first capturing group is 1
    * `[..]` indicates a character class
* `[^?#]` indicates that the class includes all characters *except* `?` and `#`
* `*` indicates that the character class is matched zero or more times
* `$` represents the end of the string. It assures that there was no extra materal after the end of the URL

## 7.2 Construction
* 2 ways to make a `RegExp` object
    * Use regular expression literal
