# 15. CSS selector engines

## 15.1 The W3C Selectors API
* 2 API are implemented in modern browsers
    * `querySelector()` accepts a CSS selector and returns the first element found, or `null` if no matching element is found
    * `querySelectorAll()` accetps a CSS selector and returns a static `NodeList` of all elements found by the selector
    
    
## 15.2 Using XPath to find elements

## 15.3 The pure-DOM implementation

### 15.3.1 Parsing the selector

## 15.4 Summary
* JavaScript-based CSS selector engines are incredibly powerful tools
* The give us the ability to easily locate virtually any DOM element on a page with a trivial amount of selector syntax
* There are many nuances to implementing a full selector engine, but the situation is rapidly improving as the browsers improve, and there's no shortage of tools to help
* Modern browsers are implementing the W3C APIs for element selection, but they've got a long way to go
* It still behooves us to create selector engines ourselves, if for no reason other than performance
* To create a selector engine, we can
    * Leverage the W3C APIs
    * Use XPath
    * Traverse the DOM ourselves for optimum performance
* The top-down approach is most popular, but it requires some cleanup operations, such as to ensure the uniqueness of elements
* A bottom-up approach avoids these operations, but it comes with its own bag of problems with respect to performance and scalability
