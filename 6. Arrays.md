# 6. Arrays
* An *array* is a linear allocation of memory in which elements are accessed by integers that are used to compute offsets
* JavaScript provides an object that has some array-like characteristics
* It converts array subscripts into strings that are used to make properties

## 6.1 Array Literals
* Is a pair of square brackets surrounding zero or more values separated by commas
* The first value will get the property name '0', second value '1', and so on

* In most languages, the elements of an array are all required to be of same type. JavaScript allows an array to contain any mixture of values
```
var misc = [
    'string', 98.6, true, false,
    ['nested'], { object: true }
];
```

## 6.2 Length
* Every array has a *length* property
* JavaScript's array *length* is not an upper bound

* The *length* property is the largest integer property name in the array plus one
* The [] postfix subscript operator converts its expression to a string using the expression's `toString` method if it has one
* That string will be used as the property name

* The *length* can be set explicitly
* Making the length larger does not allocate more space for the array
* Making the length smaller will cause all properties with a subscript that is greater or equal to the new length to be deleted

## 6.3 Delete
* `delete` operator can be used to remote elements from an array
* Leave a hole in the array
* Use `splice` method
* Every property after the deleted property must be removed and reinserted with a new key, this might not go quickly for large arrays

## 6.4 Enumeration
* Use `for` loop

## 6.5 Confusion
* When the property names are small sequential integers, you should use an array. Otherwise, use an object
* Determine if is an array
```
var isArray = function (value) {
    return value &&
        typeof value === 'object' &&
        typeof value.length === 'number' &&
        typeof value.splice === 'function' &&
        !(value.propertyIsEnumerable('length'));
}
```

## 6.6 Methods
* JavaScript provides a set of methods for acting on arrays
* The methods are functions stored in `Array.prototype`
```
Array.method('reduce', function(f, value) {
    var i;
    
    for (i = 0; i < this.length; i += 1) {
        value = f(this[i], value);
    }
    
    return value;
});
```

## 6.7 Dimensions
* JavaScript arrays are not initialized
