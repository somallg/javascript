# 3. Functions are fundamental
* JavaScript is a *functional language*
* Functions are *first-class objects*

## 3.1 What's with the functional difference?

### 3.1.1 Why is JavaScript's functional nature important?
* Function is the primary modular unit of execution
* Because most of our code will run as the result of a function invocation, having functions that are versatile and powerful constructs will give us a great deal of flexibility and sway when writing code

* Functions as first-class objects
* Objects in JavaScript enjoy certain capabilities
    * Can be created via literals
    * Can be assigned to variables, array entries, and properties of other objects
    * Can be passed as arguments to functions
    * Can be returned as values from functions
    * Can posses properties that can be dynamically created and assigned
* Functions in JavaScript possess all of those capabilities and are thus treated like any other object in the language    

* The browser event loop
* Because events happen at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order, handling of the events, and the invocation of their handling functions, is *asynchronous*

* The callback concept
* Whenever we set up a function to be called at a later time, whether by the browser or other code, we're setting up that is termed a *callback*

### 3.1.2 Sorting with a comparator
```
var values = [ 213, 16, 2058, 54, 10, 1965, 57, 9 ];
values.sort(function(value1, value2) { return value2 - value1; });
```
* The functional difference in JavaScript allows use to create a function as a standalone entity
* One of the most important features of JavaScript is the ability to create functions anywhere in the code where an expression can appear
* In addition to makeing the code more compact and easy to understand, the feature can eliminate the need to pollute the global namespace with unnecessary names when a function isn't going to be referenced from multiple places within the code

## 3.2 Declarations
* JavaScript functions are declared using a *function literal*
* Function literals are composed of 4 parts
    * The `function` keyword
    * An *optional* name, if specified, must be a valid JavaScript identifier
    * a comma-separated list of parameter names enclosed in parentheses
    * The body of the function    
    
### 3.2.1 Scoping and functions
* In JavaScript, scopes are declared by *functions*, and not by blocks
* Some nuances to the scoping rules
    * Variable declarations are in scope from their point of declaration to the end of the function within which they're declared, regardless of block nesting
    * Named functions are in scope within the entire function within which they're declared, regardless of block nesting
    * For the purposes of declaration scopes, the global context acts like one big function encompassing the code on the page

## 3.3 Invocations
* The manner in which a function is invoked has a huge impact on how the code within it operates, primarily in how the `this` parameter is established
* 4 different ways to invoke a function
    * As a function
    * As a method
    * As a constructor
    * Via its `apply()` or `call()` methods
* The function invocation operator is a set of parentheses following any expression that evaluates to a function reference
* Any arguments to be passed to the function are included inside the parentheses as a comma-separated list
