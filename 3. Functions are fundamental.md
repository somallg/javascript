# 3. Functions are fundamental
* JavaScript is a *functional language*
* Functions are *first-class objects*

## 3.1 What's with the functional difference?

### 3.1.1 Why is JavaScript's functional nature important?
* Function is the primary modular unit of execution
* Because most of our code will run as the result of a function invocation, having functions that are versatile and powerful constructs will give us a great deal of flexibility and sway when writing code

* Functions as first-class objects
* Objects in JavaScript enjoy certain capabilities
    * Can be created via literals
    * Can be assigned to variables, array entries, and properties of other objects
    * Can be passed as arguments to functions
    * Can be returned as values from functions
    * Can posses properties that can be dynamically created and assigned
* Functions in JavaScript possess all of those capabilities and are thus treated like any other object in the language    

* The browser event loop
* Because events happen at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order, handling of the events, and the invocation of their handling functions, is *asynchronous*

* The callback concept
* Whenever we set up a function to be called at a later time, whether by the browser or other code, we're setting up that is termed a *callback*

### 3.1.2 Sorting with a comparator
```
var values = [ 213, 16, 2058, 54, 10, 1965, 57, 9 ];
values.sort(function(value1, value2) { return value2 - value1; });
```
* The functional difference in JavaScript allows use to create a function as a standalone entity
* One of the most important features of JavaScript is the ability to create functions anywhere in the code where an expression can appear
* In addition to makeing the code more compact and easy to understand, the feature can eliminate the need to pollute the global namespace with unnecessary names when a function isn't going to be referenced from multiple places within the code

* Declarations
