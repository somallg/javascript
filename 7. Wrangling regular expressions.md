# 7. Wrangling regular expression
* Regular expressions trivialize the process of tearing apart strings and looking for information

## 7.1 Why regular expressions rock

## 7.2 A regular expression refresher

### 7.2.1 Regular expression explained

### 7.2.2 Terms and operators

## 7.4 Capturing matching segments

### 7.4.1 Performing simple captures

### 7.4.2 Matching using global expressions

## 7.4.3 Referencing captures

### 7.4.4 Non-capturing groups

## 7.5 Replacing using functions
* `replace()` provide a function as the replacement value rather than a fixed string
* When a replacement value is a function, it's invoked for each match found with variable list of parameters
    * Full text of the match
    * Captures of the match, one parameter for each
    * Index of the match
    * Source string
* The value returned from the function serves as the replacement value
