# 13. Surviving events

## 13.1 Binding and unbinding event handlers
* User DOM Level 2 Event Model, we bind and unbind event handlers with the standard `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()` for modern DOM-compliant browsers, and `attachEvent()` and `detachEvent()` in legacy versions of IE (prior to IE 9)

## 13.2 The Event object
* target - property denoting the original source of the event
* relatedTarget - comes into use when it's used on an event that works in conjunction with another element (mouseover or mouseout)
* preventDefault - prevents the default browser action from occurring
* stopPropagation - stops the event from bubbling further up the tree
* pageX and pageY - provide position of the mouse relative to the whole document
* which - equivalent to the key code pressed during a keyboard event
* button - identifies the mouse button clicked by the user on a mouse event

## 13.3 Handler management 

## 13.3.1 Centrally storing associated information
* Give each element a unique identifier, and then store all data associated with it in a centralized object

### 13.3.3 Managing event handlers

## 13.5 Bubbling and delegation
* *delegation* is the act of establishing event handlers at higher levels in the DOM than the items of interest

### 13.5.1 Delegating events to an ancestor
* Establish a single handler at a level higher than the cells that can handle all the events using the event bubbling provided by the browser

### 13.5.2 Working around browser dependencies

## 13.7 Summary
* 3 event-handling models in browsers
    * DOM Level 0
    * DOM Level 2
    * IE Model
* IE Model lack of proper context in the handlers
