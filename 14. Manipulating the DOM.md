## 14.5 Summary
* Using regular expressions, we can cajole HTML snippets into a well-formed syntax that we can parse
* Injecting a fragment of HTML text into a temporary element's `innerHTML` property is a quick and easy way to convert a string of HTML text into DOM elements
* Some elements, such as table component elements, need to be wrapped with certain other container elements in order for them to be properly created
* Script elements in HTML fragments can be executed in the global scope using the techniques that we examined on code evaluation
* Legacy version of IE cause headaches when cloning nodes because they copy too *much*, including event handlers and expandos
* We need to be mindful of memory management needs when removing elements from the DOM, especially when creating long-lived pages
