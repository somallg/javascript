# 5. Closing in on closures

## 5.1 How closures work
* *closure* is a scope created when a function is declared that allows the function to access and manipulate variables that are external to that function
* closures allow a function to access all the variables, as well as other functions, that are in scope when the function itself is declared

* 3 interesting concepts regarding closures
    * Function parameters are included in the closure of that function
    * All variables in an outer scope, even those declared *after* the function declaration, are included
    * Within the same scope, variables not yet defined cannot be forward-referenced

## 5.2 Putting closures to work

### 5.2.1 Private variables
* Common use of closures is to encapsulate some information as a "private variable", to limit the scope of such variables

### 5.2.2 Callbacks and timers
* Another common use is when dealing with callbacks or timers

## 5.3 Binding function contexts

## 5.4 Partially applying functions
* *prefill* arguments to a function before it's even executed
* Typically called *currying*

## 5.5 Overriding function behavior

### 5.5.1 Memoization

### 5.5.2 Function wrapping
* Encapsulating the logic of a function while overwriting it with new or extended functionality in a single step

## 5.6 Immediate functions
```
(function(){})()
```
* The result of this code is an expression that does all of the following
    * Creates a function instance
    * Executes the function
    * Discards the function
    
### 5.6.1 Temporary scope and private variables
* Self-contained wrappers for functionality
* In JavaScript, variables are scoped based upon the *closure* they're in

* Enforcing names in a scope via parameters

* Keeping code readable with shorter names

### 5.6.2 Loops
* Closures remember *references* to included variables, *not* just their values at the time at which they're created

### 5.6.3 Library wrapping
* When developing a library, it's important to not pollute the global namespace with unnecessary variables
