# 5. Closing in on closures

## 5.1 How closures work
* *closure* is a scope created when a function is declared that allows the function to access and manipulate variables that are external to that function
* closures allow a function to access all the variables, as well as other functions, that are in scope when the function itself is declared

* 3 interesting concepts regarding closures
    * Function parameters are included in the closure of that function
    * All variables in an outer scope, even those declared *after* the function declaration, are included
    * Within the same scope, variables not yet defined cannot be forward-referenced

## 5.2 Putting closures to work

### 5.2.1 Private variables
* Common use of closures is to encapsulate some information as a "private variable", to limit the scope of such variables

### 5.2.2 Callbacks and timers
* Another common use is when dealing with callbacks or timers
