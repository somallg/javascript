9. Ninja alchemy runtime code evaluation

## 9.1 Code evaluation mechanisms
* `eval()` function
* Function constructors
* Timers
* The `<script>` element

### 9.1.1 Evaluation with the eval() method
* Executes the code passed into it in string form, within the current context
* Return the result of last evaluated expression
* Anything isn't a simple variable, primitive, or assignment will need to be wrapped in parentheses in order for the correct value to be returned
* Function created with `eval()` inherit the closure of that scope - a ramification of the fact that `eval()` executes within the local scope

### 9.1.2 Evaluation via the Function constructor
```
var add = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
assert(add(3, 4) == 7, 'Function created and working!');
```
* No closures are created when functions are created via the `Function` constructor

### 9.1.3 Evaluation with timers
* `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` also accept strings that will be evaluated when the timers fire
```
var tick = window.setTimeout('alert("Hi!")', 100);
```

### 9.1.4 Evaluation in the global scope

### 9.1.5 Safe code evaluation

## 9.2 Function "decompilation"
* Value returned by `toString()` will contain all the whitespace of the original declaration, *including* line terminators

## 9.3 Code evaluating in action

### 9.3.1 Converting JSON

### 9.3.2 Importing namespaced code

### 9.3.3 JavaScript compression and obfuscation
* Smaller code may download faster, but doesn't always *evaluate* faster

### 9.3.4 Dynamic code rewriting

### 9.3.5 Aspect-oriented script tags
* AOP is a technique by which code is injected and executed at runtime to handle "cross-cutting" thing like logging, caching, security, and so on

### 9.3.6 Metalanguages and DSLs

## 9.4 Summary
* 4 mechanism that JavaScript provide for evaluating strings of JavaScript code at runtime
    * `eval()`
    * Function constructors
    * Timers
    * Dynamic `<script>` blocks
* *function decompilation* obtaining a string for the code for a function via a function's `toString()` method
