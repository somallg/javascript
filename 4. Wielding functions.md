# 4. Weilding functions

## 4.1 Anonymous functions
* Anonymous functions are typically used in cases where we wish to create a function for later use, such as storing it in a variable, establishing it as a method of an object, or using it as a callback
* Functions are much more ethereal; they're frequently defined as needed, and discarded just as quickly
* Functional programming concentrates on small, usually side-effect-free, functions as the basic building blocks of application code

## 4.2 Recursion
* Whenever a function calls itself, or calls a function that in turn calls the original function anywhere in the call tree, recursion occurs

### 4.2.1 Recursion in named functions

### 4.2.2 Recursion with methods

### 4.2.3 The pilfered reference problem

### 4.2.4 Inline named functions
* Nothing wrong with giving *any* function literal a name, even those that are declared as callbacks or methods
* No longer *anonymous*, these functions are better called *inline functions*

### 4.2.5 The callee property

## 4.3 Fun with function as objects

### 4.3.1 Storing functions

### 4.3.2 Self-memoizing functions
* *Memoization* is the process of building a function that's capable of remembering its previously computed values
* Can markedly increase performance by avoiding needless complex computations that have already been performed

* Memoizing expensive computations
* 2 major advantages
    * Enjoys performance benefits for function calls
    * Happens completely seamlessly and behind the scenes
* Disadvantages
    * Consume more memory
    * Mixed logic with business logic
    * Difficult to load-test or measure the performance
    
* Memoizing DOM elements

### 4.3.3 Faking array methods

## 4.4 Variable-length argument lists
* Function can accept an arbitrary number of arguments
* Key to implement overloading

### 4.4.1 Using aplly() to supply variable arguments
*
