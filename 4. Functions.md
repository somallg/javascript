# 4. Functions
* Functions are the fundamental modular unit of JavaScript
* Used for code reuse, information hiding, and composition
* Used to specify the behavior of objects
* Generally, the craft of programming is the factoring of a set of requirements into a set of functions and data structures

## 4.1 Function Objects
* Functions in JavaScript are objects
* Objects are collections of name/value pairs having a hidden link to a prototype object
* Object produced from object literals are linked to `Object.prototype`
* Function objects are linked to `Function.prototype` (which is itself linked to `Object.prototype`)
* Every function is also created with two additional hidden properties: the function's context and the code that implements the function's behavior

* Every function object is also created with a `prototype` property
* Its value is an object with a `constructor` property whose value is the function

* Functions can be used like any other value
* Since functions are objects, functions can have methods

* Thing that is special about functions is that they can be invoked

## 4.2 Function Literal
* Function objects are created with function literals
```
var add = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
