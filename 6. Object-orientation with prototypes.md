# 6. Object-orientation with prototypes
* Prototypes are a convenient way to *define* types of objects, but they're actually a feature of functions

## 6.1 Instantiation and prototypes
* All functions have a *prototype* property that initially references an empty object
* This property doesn't serve much purpose until the function is used as a *constructor*

### 6.1.1 Object instantiation
* Prototypes as object blueprints

* Instance properties
* The precedence of the initialization operations is important and goes as follows
    * Properties are bound to the object instance from the prototype
    * Properties are added to the object instance within the constructor function

* Reconciling references
* The prototype isn't copied, but rather, is attached to the constructed object and consulted during the reconciling of property references made to the object
* Property references are resolved in the object *first*, defaulting to inspecting the prototype only if that fails

### 6.1.2 Object typing via constructors

### 6.1.3 Inheritance and the prototype chain
