# 6. Object-orientation with prototypes
* Prototypes are a convenient way to *define* types of objects, but they're actually a feature of functions

## 6.1 Instantiation and prototypes
* All functions have a *prototype* property that initially references an empty object
* This property doesn't serve much purpose until the function is used as a *constructor*

### 6.1.1 Object instantiation
* Prototypes as object blueprints

* Instance properties
* The precedence of the initialization operations is important and goes as follows
    * Properties are bound to the object instance from the prototype
    * Properties are added to the object instance within the constructor function

* Reconciling references
* The prototype isn't copied, but rather, is attached to the constructed object and consulted during the reconciling of property references made to the object
* Property references are resolved in the object *first*, defaulting to inspecting the prototype only if that fails

### 6.1.2 Object typing via constructors

### 6.1.3 Inheritance and the prototype chain
* Best technique for creating prototype chain is to use an instance of an object as the object's prototype
```
SubClass.prototype = new SuperClass();
```

### 6.1.4 HTML DOM prototypes

## 6.2 The gotchas!

### 6.2.1 Extending Object
* Most egregious mistake is to extend the native `Object.prototype`. *All* objects receive those additional properties

### 6.2.2 Extending Number
* In general, its best to avoid mucking around with `Number` prototype unless you really need to

### 6.2.3 Subclassing native objects

## 6.2.4 Instantiation issues
* More than a merely causing unexpected errors, when a function meant to be called as a function isn't, it can have subtle side effects such as polluting the current scope

### 6.3 Writing class-like code
* A system that trivializes the syntax of building new constructor functions and prototypes
* An easy way to perform prototype inheritance
* A way of accessing methods overridden by the function's prototype

### 6.3.1 Checking for function serializability
* *Function serialization* is the act of taking a function and getting its text source back
