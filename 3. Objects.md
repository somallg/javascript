# 3. Objects
* Simple types of JavaScript are numbers, strings, booleans, null and undefined
* All other values are *objects*

* An object is a container of properties, where a property has a name and value
* A property name can be any string, including the empty string
* A property value can be any JavaScript value except for `undefined`

## 3.1 Object Literals
* An object literal is a pair of curly braces surrounding zero or more name/value pairs
```
var empty_object = {};

var foo = {
    'first-name': 'Foo',
    'last-name': 'Bar',
    'bar': 'bar'
};
```
* A property' value can be obtained from any expression, including another object literal

## 3.2 Retrieval
* Values can be retrieved from an object by wrapping a string expression in a [ ] suffix
```
foo['first-name'] // Foo
foo.bar // bar
```
* If the string expression is a constant, and if it is a legal JavaScript name and not a reserved word then the . notation can be used instead

* The `undefined` value is produced if an attempt is made to retrieve a nonexistent member
* The || operator can be used to fill in default values
* Attempting to retrieve values from undefined will throw an TypeError exception
* Can be guarded against with the && operator

## 3.3 Update
* A value in an object can be updated by assignment
* If the property name already exists in the object, the property is replaced
* If the object does not already have that property name, the object is augmented

## 3.4 Reference
* Objet are passed around by reference. They are never copied
```
var x = foo;
x.nickname = 'Bar';
var nick = foo.nickname // Bar
```

## 3.5 Prototype
* Every object is linked to a prototype object from which it can inherit properties
* All objects create from object literals are linked to `Object.prototype`

```
if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
    Object.create = function(o) {
        var F = function() {};
        F.prototype = o;
        return new F();
    }
}
```

* The prototype link has no effect on updating

* The prototype link is used only in retrieval

* The prototype relationship is a dynamic relationship. If we add a new property to a prototype, that prototype will immediately be visible in all of the object that are based on that prototype

## 3.6 Reflection
* The `typeof` operator can be very helpful in determining the type of a property
* `hasOwnProperty` return `true` if the object has a particular property
* It does not look at the prototype chain

## 3.7 Enumeration
* The `for in` statement can loop over all of the property names in an object
* The enumeration will include all of the properties - including functions and prototype properties that you might not be interested in - necessary to filter out the values

* There is no guarantee on the order of the names

## 3.8 Delete
* The `delete` operator can be used to remove a property from an object
* It will remove a property from the object if it has one
* It will not touch any of the objects in the prototype linkage

## 3.9 Global Abatement
* JavaScript makes it easy to define global variables that can hold all of the assets of your application
* One way to minimize the use of global variables is to create a single global variable for you app
```
var myApp = {};
```
