# 11. Developing cross-browser strategies 

## 11.1 Choosing which browsers to support
* When choose to support a browser, we are making
    * Test again that browser with our test suite
    * Fix bugs and regressions associated with that browser
    * Execution with a reasonable performance
* *Quality should never be sacrificed for coverage*

## 11.2 The five major development concerns
* 5 points
    * Browser bugs
    * Browser bug fixes
    * Missing features in the browsers
    * External code
    * Browser regressions

### 11.2.1 Browser bugs and differences
* Good test coverage

### 11.2.2 Browser bug fixes
* 2 problem with handling browser bugs
    * Our code is liable to break when the bug fix is eventually instituted
    * We could end up training browser vendors to *not* fix bugs for fear of causing websites to break
* When determining if a piece of functionality is potentially a bug, always verify it with the specification    

### 11.2.3 Living with external code and markup
* Any reusable code must coexist with the code that surrounds it
* Encapsulating our code

### 11.2.4 Missing features

### 11.2.5 Regressions
* Hardest problems: bugs, non-backward-compatible API changes that browsers have introduced and cause our code to break
* Anticipating changes

## 11.3 Implementation strategies

### 11.3.1 Safe cross-browser fixes
* Simplest (safest) classes of cross-browser fixes
    * Have no negative or side effects on other browsers
    * Use no form of browser or feature detection
    
### 11.3.2 Object detection
* Works by determining if a certain object or object property exists, and if so, assuming that it provides the implied functionality
* Most commonly, object detection is used to choose between multiple APIs that provide duplicate pieces of functionality
* Good way to check that a feature *exist*

### 11.3.3 Feature simulation
* Performs a complete run-through of a feature to make sure that it works as we'd expect it to

### 11.3.4 Untestable browser issues
* Event handler bindings
* Event firing
* CSS property effects
* Browser crashes

## 11.4 Reducing assumptions

## 11.5 Summary
* Reusable cross-browser development involves 3 factors
    * Code size - keeping the file size small
    * Performance overhead - keeping the performance level above a palatable minimum
    * API quality - making sure that the APIs provided work uniformly across browsers
* There's no magic formula for determining the correct balance of thse factors
* The development factors are something that will have to be balanced by every developer in their individual development efforts
* By using object detection and feature simulation, it's possible to defend against numerous directions from which reusable code will be attacked without making any undue sacrifices
