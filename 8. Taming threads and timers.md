8. Taming threads and timers
* Timers is not feature of JavaScript but are provided as part of the objects and methods that the web browser makes available
* Timers provide ability to asynchronously delay the execution of a piece of code by a number of milliseconds

## 8.1. How timers and threading work

### 8.1.1 Setting and clearing timers
* 2 methods to create timers and 2 corresponding methods to clear them
```
setTimeout
clearTimeout
setInterval
clearInterval
```

### 8.1.2 Timer execution within the execution thread
* Handlers for asynchronous events, such as interface events and timers are only executed when there's nothing else already running
* Because JavaScript is single-threaded, only one unit of execution can ever be running at a given time, and we can never be certain that timer handlers will execute exactly when we expect

### 8.1.3 Differences between timeouts and intervals
* JavaScript engines execute only a single thread at a time, forcing asynchronous events to queue up awaiting execution
* If a timer is blocked from immediately executing, it will be delayed until the next available time of execution
* Intervals may end up executing back to back with no delay if they get backed up enough, and multiple instances of the same interval handler will never be queued up
* `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` are fundamentally different in how their firing frequencies are determined

## 8.2 Minimum timer delay and reliability

## 8.3

## 8.4 Central timer control
* We only need one timer running per page at a time
* We can pause and resume the timers at will
* The process for removing callback functions is trivialized

## 8.5 Asynchronous testing

## 8.6 Summary
* Timers is especially useful in complex applications, including
    * Computationally intensive code
    * Animations
    * Asynchronous test suites
