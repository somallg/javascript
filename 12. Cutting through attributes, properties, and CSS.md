# 12. Developing cross-browser strategies 
* Attributes are an integral part of how the DOM get built
* Properties are the primary means by which elements hold runtime information, and by which this information can be accessed

## 12.1 DOM attributes and properties
* 2 options to accessing value of element attributes
    * Using DOM methods `getAttribute` and `setAttribute`
    * Using properties of the DOM objects that correspond to the attributes
```
e.getAttribute('id')
e.id
```
* Attribute and corresponding property, while linked, aren't always identical

### 12.1.1 Cross-browser naming
* When it comes to naming of attributes and their corresponding properties, property names are generally more consistent from browser to browser

### 12.1.2 Naming restrictions
* Attributes, being represented by strings passed to DOM methods, can be named with a rather free reign
* Property names, which can be referenced as identifiers using the dot operator notation, are more restricted, as they must conform to the rules for identifiers, and there are some reserved words that are disallowed

### 12.1.3 Differences between XML and HTML
* When dealing with XML DOM, no properties are automatically created on the elements to represent attribute values

### 12.1.4 Behavior of custom attributes
