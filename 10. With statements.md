# 10. With statements

## 10.1 What's with "with"?
* `with` statement creates a scope within which the properties of a specified object can be referenced without a prefix
* Useful
    * Shortening references to an object in a deep hierarchy
    * Simplifying test code
    * Exposing properties as top-level references to template

### 10.1.1 Referencing properties within a scope
* Within the scope of the `with` statement, the object's properties take absolute precedence over variables of the same name in higher-level scopes

### 10.1.2 Assignments within a with scope
* Unprefixed references can't be used to create new properties

### 10.1.3 Performance considerations
* Slows down the execution performance of any JavaScript that it encompasses

## 10.2 Real-world examples

## 10.3 Importing namespaced code

## 10.4 Testing
