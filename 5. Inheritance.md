# 5. Inheritance
* In classical languages (Java(, inheritance (or *extends*) provide 2 useful services
    * Code reuse
    * Includes the specification of a system of types
    
* JavaScript, being a loosely typed language, never casts. What matters about an object is what it can do, not what it is descended from

* In classical languages, objects are instances of classes, and class can inherit from another class
* JavaScript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects

## 5.1 Pseudoclassical
* The `prototype` object is the place where inherited traits are to be deposited
